# SayMyName

Whenever I'm at work, listening to music or on the street, with headphones on, I'm disconnected from the world. Wouldn't it be great if my phone/smartwatch would notify me when someone is trying to get my attention? POC of application that can notify a user when their name is being called out, words like "danger" or "fire", even configure fire alarms or ice cream truck songs. This has many applications for deaf/hard of hearing users who benefit from notifications like these.
