In order to empower people and organizations, we can provide solutions that promote inclusion in everyday life. Deaf/hard of hearing people are often confronted with situations where they have a disadvantage in environments where there are mostly hearing people, specially in situations where their disability is invisible. We want to provide a tool for word and sound recognition using mobile platforms, so that users get notifications along with haptic feedback when this tool recognizes any of the configured sounds and words in their surroundings.

Alternatively, at work, home, or on the street, some people use headphones and are disconnected from the world. This tool would enable hearing users to take advantage and get a bit more connected in their environment, without interrupting their use of headphones.

Goal: POC of application that can notify a user when their name is being called out, words like "danger" or "fire", even configure fire alarms or ice cream truck songs.
